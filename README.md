# Landing Page - The Odin Project
## Assignment:
A landing page.
The website  has 4 main sections (and a footer), so pick one and get it into pretty good shape before moving on. Starting at the top is always a solid plan.
For the section youâ€™re working on, begin by getting all the content onto the page before beginning to style it. In other words, do the HTML and then do the CSS.

## The project idea:
The proposed project for the solution of this assignment is the creation of a landing page for a fictitious pet shop, made on html and css, in which will show the services that pet shop offers.
